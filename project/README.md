# DSCI 1412 Spring 2023 Project
## Project Overview
Your task for this project is to select a public dataset and conduct a comprehensive data analysis based on your own formulated questions. This assignment encourages your critical thinking and creativity to generate data analysis questions and hypotheses. Your analysis should encompass numerical (quantitative), graphical (visual), and statistical methods, as appropriate.
## Guidelines for the Project
- Formulating Questions: Choose a topic that is interesting and relevant to your dataset. Your data analysis questions should be clear, focused, concise, complex, and arguable.
- Data Analysis: Perform an exploratory data analysis, clean the data if necessary, and handle missing values and outliers. Your analysis should be thorough and methodical. Any challenges faced during data cleaning or preprocessing should be noted and briefly discussed in your presentation.
Classification or Regression: Depending on your dataset and questions, you may need to apply classification or regression techniques. Make sure to apply the correct models and evaluate them using appropriate metrics.
- Visualization: Use suitable plots and graphs to visualize your findings. Effective visualizations can significantly enhance the comprehensibility of your data and results.
- Conclusion: Summarize your findings and draw clear, evidence-based conclusions from your analysis.
## Group Work
This project allows for collaboration in groups of up to three students. Working in a team will provide a taste of the collaborative nature of data science and can foster a diverse range of perspectives and complementary strengths. Please note that all group members are expected to contribute equally to the project and the presentation.
## Dataset Selection
A variety of [datasets](datasets.md) are provided for your consideration in this shared [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g_tmm8uonPfOvor1OWVPH_sTpMiMSL-32F2uVpqzz6c/edit?usp=sharing). Please form your groups and select your preferred datasets from this document. Dataset selection is on a first-come, first-served basis, so act promptly. Once you've chosen a dataset, please sign up in the shared document so that it can be marked as taken.
## Submission and Presentation
The deadline for project submissions is May 21st. You should submit a Python notebook detailing your analysis. The notebook should be clearly structured, with comments and markdown cells explaining your code and thought process.
Following this, each group will present their analyses and findings in an oral presentation on May 22nd. Your presentation should be approximately 15 minutes long and cover the following:
- Introduction: Briefly explain your chosen dataset and the data analysis question(s) you aimed to answer.
- Methods: Discuss the data analysis methods and models you applied, explaining your choice and any challenges you faced during the data cleaning or preprocessing.
- Results: Present your findings. Utilize your visualizations to aid in conveying your results.
- Conclusion: Summarize the implications of your findings and how they answer your data analysis question(s).
Remember, clarity and engagement are key to a successful presentation!
## Evaluation Criteria
- Your project will be evaluated on the following:
- Clarity and relevance of the data analysis question
- Rigor and correctness of the data analysis
- Appropriateness of the classification or regression model and its evaluation
- Use of effective visualizations
- Soundness of the conclusions drawn
- Quality and clarity of the presentation

Please note that both the Python notebook and the presentation will be considered when grading.

Good luck, everyone!
